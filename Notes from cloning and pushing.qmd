## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Notes from 1/23/25

Generating a script that will extract the female mean body mass and brain size into a vector for producing a bivariate plot:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
d <- read_csv("data-wrangling.csv")
fbm <- d$Body_mass_female_mean
bs <- d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
plot(fbm, bs)
```

To generate this plot in a logarithmic scale, utilize the plot(**log**("")) function.

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
d <- read_csv("data-wrangling.csv")
fbm <- d$Body_mass_female_mean
bs <- d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
plot(log(fbm), log(bs))
```

Upon clicking "Enter", your plot will generate in a pop up window :)
